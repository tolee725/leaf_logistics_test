## Goal

Your assignment is to create a SPA to display and browse the top news of the [News API endpoint](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines). The API is free for development purposes but the content coming from the server is limited to 260 characters.

Below you'll find some wireframes for inspiration, you are not required to implement them 100% like this.

The aim of this exercise is to show us how you think about code to solve the problem at hand. The primary criteria for judgment are basic software engineering and architectural principles.

## Functionality

* A way to switch between countries, e.g. US and UK

* An overview of the top news items and a way to access the detail page

* A search to filter the news

## Restrictions

* We prefer it if you use a framework like or similar to React. Alternatively you can do it in Vanilla, Vue or Svelte

* If you want you can use TS but ES is fine too

* Use any utility libraries you want

## Delivery method

The solution should be provided as a Git repository on GitHub.
